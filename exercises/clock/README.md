# Exercise: Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates. You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

## Working on the example

1. There are four tests, three of them are ignored
2. Remove the `#[ignore]` macro over each test case to add them to your test suite
3. Run `cargo test` or `cargo test --release` to run your tests
4. Use the `main` function if you want to try things out.
5. Run `cargo run` or `cargo run --release` to run your main function

## Goals

1. Create structs
2. Create `impl` blocks
3. Create associated functions (methods)
