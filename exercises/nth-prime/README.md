# Exercise: Nth Prime

Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

## Working on the example

1. There are four tests, three of them are ignored
2. Remove the `#[ignore]` macro over each test case to add them to your test suite
3. Run `cargo test` or `cargo test --release` to run your tests
4. Use the `main` function if you want to try things out.
5. Run `cargo run` or `cargo run --release` to run your main function
